	<h1>Artist Statement</h1>
	<p>Hello, one and all. My name is Shivani Walia. This is the very first website that I have created. There is a lot that I would love to share with you all. Images are one of those things. There is a lot of beauty and wonder on this planet of our's. These two things, beauty and wonder, come in different sizes and shapes and forms. There are so many things to appreciate and be happy over, and the image links I have provided are a way for me to share that with everyone.
  <p>I am a student. I also work a part-time job. I attend San Jose State University, and am currently a senior. It's been a very fun and enjoyable experience so far. This is the very first website that I have created, and I'm very proud with how it turned out.
